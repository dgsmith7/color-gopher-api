# color-gopher-api

Intro:

Color Gopher API is a REST API that converts colors and generates on-demand palettes. Users can ask the Color Gopher to convert between RGB, HSV, HSL, CMYK, HEX, and CSS-named-colors. This can be done one at a time, or all at once in a single request. The Color Gopher can also generate palettes based on the input color.

Those palettes are:  
complement  
split complement  
adjacent  
analogous  
phi (golden angle) triad  
equilateral triad  
phi (golden angle) tetrad  
equlateral tetrad  
monochromatic  
interpolation in 7 steps between two colors

This API is available on RapidAPI at color-gopher-api.
